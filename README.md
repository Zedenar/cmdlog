------------------------------------------------
I am building on this project - only for me to learn more from Python 3.
The code has bin documented as good as my abilities goes.
The structure is documented within settings/config.py .
Feel free to re-use my code in any way you seem fit.

Note: You will need to save this project inside a folder named "cmdlog" (without quotes).
